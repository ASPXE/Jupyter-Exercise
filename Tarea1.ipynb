    "- **Scikit-learn**: Includes algorithms for supervised and unsupervised learning, data preprocessing, and model evaluation.\n",
    "- **TensorFlow**: Mainly used for machine learning and deep learning. One of its advantages is that it can execute code on either CPU or GPU, with the choice depending on the type of model being trained.\n",
    "- **Keras**: Built on TensorFlow, it focuses on constructing neural networks and training ML models.\n",
    "- **PyTorch**: Similar to Keras, it is used for creating neural networks. Its difference from Keras is that it allows dynamic execution and is more commonly used in research environments.\n"
